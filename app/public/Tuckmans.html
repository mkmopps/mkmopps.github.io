    <p>While doing this analysis, we believe we are in the early stages of storming. The EY case really brought the team closer together, and everyone was able to get a very general idea of how people communicated and what skills they had. During the forming stage, we were able to collaborate and develop a team contract that will be used to hold everyone on the team to the same standards. Going into the storming stage, we know things might get difficult. It will be a time when we really get to know each other and what each member is truly capable of. There will definitely be disagreements, but this will force us to question and really do some critical thinking. This will also be an opportunity for us to discover who is really good at what. With upcoming projects that have a short deadline, it will be essential for us to utilize the skills of the members within the group. This transitions into our norming stage, where we really start to get a grasp of how to approach projects. We expect to reach this point in the next couple of weeks, simply due to the fact that we are working with each other almost every day. Once we determine the best way for us to work, we will be performing. </p>
      <p>We understand that the performance stage can have different expectations depending on the group. For us, we consider performing to be when we are using our time efficiently to complete assignments to the best of our abilities. Depending on some of the assignments, we know we may return to one of the previous stages. By the end of the Core, we want to take as much as we can from this experience. From the Qualtrics surveys throughout the semester, along with team discussions, we will evaluate the feedback we receive so that we can improve our next team experience. We also want to continue to stay connected and use each other as resources in the professional world after we officially adjourn. </p>
