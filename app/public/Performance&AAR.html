    <p>The EY case was just the beginning, and we had not established roles quite yet, so the direction for finding a solution was not there. However, we believe we started off well by actually sitting down to collaborate and find a solution to the project together. Having this initial experience definitely gave us an idea for the kind of work that is ahead of us. We know that there are still many ways for us to improve, as well as future challenges ahead. Our goal is to have an either equal or greater performance with each project and assignment. We know that there may be times when we do not meet our goal, but when that happens, we will take the time to reflect on our performance and determine how we can improve. Our ultimate goal is to reach the highest performing level and have our team working like a well oiled machine.</p>

    <h5>EY Case After Action Report</h5>

  <br>
  <p>We approached the EY case like most assignments. We decided that we wanted to try our best and find a solution for the case. The case itself was very plain, and there did not seem to be a very clear answer. We had no real idea what we should research or how to learn about the industry with such little time. Using the resources we had available, we pushed through to create a deliverable we could feel good about. While we recognize that our solution might not have been the most appropriate solution for the case, it was a solid start. From the evaluation of our case and our IT classes that further broke down how to approach a case, we now have a better idea of what we need to do to research, create, and present a solution for future cases. These changes will take some time to take full effect, but we hope to become more efficient with our time and create high quality content. By experimenting with new strategies and giving team members the chance to try out different roles, we hope to have our objectives start to align with our realities.</p>

    <h5>ERP Case and Simulation</h5>

  <br>
  <p>Leading up to the final simulation, we had done very well on team assignments and had a good understanding of the processes in SAP. However, these assignments did not include 'real-time' transactions. We used the practice rounds to become familiar with the transactions and running MRP. The practice rounds were not great for us, and we were still struggling to come up with a solid strategy that would allow us to achieve a high ranking. At the end of the last practice simulation, we learned that we were running MRP too often, which resulted in us not having enough raw materials for production. We took what we learned and tried to form a basic strategy that we could start with for the final simulation. Each member had a responsibility: run MRP, convert purchase orders, ###, check inventory. This required us to communicate throughout all four rounds of the simulation. In the first round, we placed last. This forced us to really focus and experiment with our strategy. We worked well under pressure, and no problems arose from team members. As a team, we knew what everyone was capable of and we could trust each other to make decisions that would benefit the team. As we worked through the simulation, we made sure to complete all the requirements for the assignment, which meant we also had to sacrifice sales. In the end, we placed ninth, which was a great improvement from where we started.  </p>

    <h5>D&S Final Project</h5>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <img src="img/DS_AAR.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="" style="padding: 30px">
  <br>
  <p> We approached the D&S project with a little more caution because none of us were as technically skilled as we would have liked to been for this project. We had an outline of a website that we wanted to try and create and a scheme that we created in order to help us guide our way through the project. During the first half the project we felt good about getting our work done and we seemed to be on track and our code and database worked. However, as we got into the latter half of the project and our work became more focused on JavaScript and PHP we started to falter. Our meetings became longer and our frustration grew as our code started to work less and less. However, we pushed through and we reached out a few times to other classmates in the core, our GAs and our professor. They helped us get back on the right track and we learned an incredible amount about debugging in a short time. Overall as a team, we grew in our technical skills and in the future we know to plan more time for when we are stuck and hope to experiment later in growing our technical skills more and to gain a better understanding of web development. </p>
