    <p>The EY case was just the beginning, and we had not established roles quite yet, so the direction for finding a solution was not there. However, we believe we started off well by actually sitting down to collaborate and find a solution to the project together. Having this initial experience definitely gave us an idea for the kind of work that is ahead of us. We know that there are still many ways for us to improve, as well as future challenges ahead. Our goal is to have an either equal or greater performance with each project and assignment. We know that there may be times when we do not meet our goal, but when that happens, we will take the time to reflect on our performance and determine how we can improve. Our ultimate goal is to reach the highest performing level and have our team working like a well oiled machine.</p>

  <p>We approached the EY case like most assignments. We decided that we wanted to try our best and find a solution for the case. The case itself was very plain, and there did not seem to be a very clear answer. We had no real idea what we should research or how to learn about the industry with such little time. Using the resources we had available, we pushed through to create a deliverable we could feel good about. While we recognize that our solution might not have been the most appropriate solution for the case, it was a solid start. From the evaluation of our case and our IT classes that further broke down how to approach a case, we now have a better idea of what we need to do to research, create, and present a solution for future cases. These changes will take some time to take full effect, but we hope to become more efficient with our time and create high quality content. By experimenting with new strategies and giving team members the chance to try out different roles, we hope to have our objectives start to align with our realities.</p>
